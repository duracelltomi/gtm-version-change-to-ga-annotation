# Automatically Annotate GA4 with New Live GTM Versions

Use this Google Apps Script to automate the creation of Google Analytics annotations whenever a new version of a Google Tag Manager container goes live.

## Ingredients

- A Google Cloud project with active billing (this script won't incur extra costs)
- Google Tag Manager API enabled in the Google Cloud project
- Google Analytics Data API enabled in the Google Cloud project
- OAuth Consent Screen set up in the Google Cloud project
- Edit access to the Google Analytics property where annotations need to be added
- Read access to the Google Tag Manager containers where new live versions are checked

## Limitations

- GTM API quota limits: https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/api/v2/limits-quotas  
  - Future versions of this script may include a solution to mitigate rate limits  
  - The per-project, per-day quota may limit your ability to use a single instance of this script with many GTM containers  
- Google Apps Script runtime is limited to 6 minutes: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/quotas

## Installation

- Make sure you perform all steps using the same Google account
- Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/ and either [create a new project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project) or select an existing Google Cloud project  
	- Make sure [billing is enabled](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project) in the project (this script will not incur extra costs)  
	- [Enable the required APIs](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/enable-api) if they are not already enabled:  
		- [Tag Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/tagmanager.googleapis.com/)  
		- [Google Analytics Admin API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/analyticsadmin.googleapis.com/)  
	- [Set up the OAuth consent screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent) and add these three scopes:  
		- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tagmanager.readonly  
		- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.edit  
		- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request  
- Go to https://script.google.com/ and click **New Project** on the top left of the page  
	- Next to the Apps Script logo, click the project name and enter something meaningful, like "Automatically Annotate GA4 with New Live GTM Versions"  
	- Go to **Project Settings** (gear icon on the left) and enable the checkbox next to *Show "appsscript.json" manifest file in editor*  
	- Under the "Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project" section, click the **Change project** button and enter the project number (not the project ID) of your Google Cloud project. You can find the project number on your [Google Cloud Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard)  
	- Return to the Editor and create all files available in the repository, except for `appsscript.json`, which will already be shown  
	- Edit `appsscript.json` with the content found in this repository. Adjust the timezone if needed  
	- Copy and paste the content of each `.gs` file into the editor. You can either paste everything into the default `Code.gs` file or create separate files in Apps Script. The end result will be the same; organizing files is just a matter of preference  
	- Add your IDs and parameters into the `GTM_TO_GA_FLOWS` constant. This is an array of objectsâ€”you can include just one or multiple items, but keep in mind that all APIs have rate and usage limits  
- To test if it works, run the `checkAndLog()` function in `main.gs` manually and check the execution logs  
	- During the first run, you will be prompted to grant permissions  
- If manual checks pass, you can trigger the same function periodically by going to **Triggers** in your Google Apps Script project and creating a time-driven trigger (e.g., hourly) for `checkAndLog()`

## Support

This is an open-source project I created in my free time to give back to the community. Support is therefore limited. You can open tickets on the Issues tab, but response times may vary.
